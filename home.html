  <p class="body"> The song that was charting on my birthweek was "Everything You Want" by Vertical Horizon. It's a rock song with a really interesting music video! The song was charting on the US Billboard on July 13, 2000, and it also was the most played single of the year 2000. The song was listened to all around the world. Here is a chart of the songs peak position, in many different countries and rankings. </p>
